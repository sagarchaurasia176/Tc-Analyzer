# Tc-Analyzer

A Time Complexity Analyzer is a tool or program that helps determine how efficiently an algorithm or piece of code runs.
-  It analyzes the algorithm's performance, especially as the input size grows, 
- provides information on the time complexity, which tells you how the execution time increases in relation to the input size. 
- This helps developers understand if their code is efficient or if it might slow down with larger inputs.
